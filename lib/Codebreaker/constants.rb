  START_MESSAGE = "
  Codebreaker is a logic game in which a code-breaker tries to break a secret code created by a code-maker.

  The code-maker, which will be played by the application weâ€™re going to write, creates a secret code of four numbers between 1 and 6. 
  
  The code-breaker then gets some number of chances to break the code. In each turn, the code-breaker makes a guess of four numbers. The code-maker then marks the guess with up to four + and - signs.

  A + indicates an exact match: one of the numbers in the guess is the same as one of the numbers in the secret code and in the same position.

  A - indicates a number match: one of the numbers in the guess is the same as one of the numbers in the secret code but in a different position."
